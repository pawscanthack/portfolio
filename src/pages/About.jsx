              Hello! I'm <strong>Scott Davis</strong>, a cybersecurity and IT professional based in Bellevue, WA. 
              With a strong foundation in <em>IT support</em>, <em>network administration</em>, and <em>security operations</em>, 
              I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and customer-first service to every challenge I tackle.

            <h2>Cybersecurity is a Lifestyle</h2>
            <p>
              In todayâ€™s digital age, <strong>IT is cybersecurity</strong>â€”and for me, it's more than just a profession; 
              it's a way of life. I thrive on solving complex problems, automating workflows with scripting, and ensuring 
              systems run securely and efficiently. My experience spans across cloud platforms like <em>Azure</em>, identity 
              management with <em>Entra</em> and <em>Active Directory</em>, and endpoint administration using <em>Intune</em> 
              and <em>PowerShell</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether it's a <strong>part-time</strong>, <strong>full-time</strong>, <strong>contract</strong>, or 
              <strong>volunteer</strong> opportunity, Iâ€™m passionate about contributing to teams that value innovation, 
              security, and collaboration. Iâ€™ve supported diverse environments, responded to security incidents, and helped 
              organizations recover from ransomware attacksâ€”all while maintaining a 96% customer satisfaction rate.

            <h2>Beyond the Keyboard</h2>
            <p>
              Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar ðŸŽ¸, diving into <em>Hack The Box</em> challenges, gaming, and spending 
              time with my two miniature Australian shepherds, <strong>Shu</strong> and <strong>Yulie</strong>. 
              I believe that staying curious and creative is key to thriving in tech.
